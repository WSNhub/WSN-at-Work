Workshop 1 : build your Love-Emitting-Device (*)
----------------
Place, date & time :  C11_03_(), Monday Nov 30th, 17u00-18u30

What do you have to bring :
-	yourself,
-	prototyping material to build the LED node (excluding led),  (**)
-	laptop with working USB & Wifi. Note that the platform connects via USB type B or mini-USB. Please check once you receive it, different variants exists.

What can you expect :
-	walk through of different hardware components (platform & RF),
-	installation and explanation of toolchain,
-	different ways to program it,
-	explanation of counter sensor & LED actuator program, (based on MySensor API)
-	integration in existing WSN@work network. Similar to demo youve seen during Agenda meeting

Available material :
-	LED with resistor, (will be reused in upcoming sessions)
-	WSN@work network : gateway & controller


Workshop 2 : control your Love-Emitting-Device
----------------
Place, date & time : F0_09_(Indian Ocean), Tuesday Dec 8th, 17u00-18u30

What do you have to bring :
-	yourself,
-	LED node from workshop 1,
-	Configured laptop from workshop 1.

What can you expect :
-	walk through of Openhab controller,
-	installation and configuration on Raspberry Pi v2,
-	add your LED-node to the controller,
-	talk about 2016 agenda. (building specific node, MQTT gateway, Openhab automation,)

Available material :
-	WSN@work network : gateway & controller
-	OPTIONAL : in case you would like to build your own RPI-based controller, please bring your hardware. As the gateway is implemented as an MQTT client, more controller can co-exist on the same LAN.

After workshop 1, the WSN@work network will be available on D2. 
Depending on Murphy and other external factors, agenda may change. Most important is that everyone gets most fun out of their nodes.

(*) once you master controlling a LED, you can control whatever other actuator. The rest is electronics. ?
(**) in case you didn't receive your goodies, don't let this stop the fun to join. Please ping me.
