This zip file contains optional bundles that can be manually added to the
openHAB runtime by simply copying them to ${openhab.home}/addons.

Each bundle (jar file) is a feature that can be installed independently from
any other bundle in this zip file.
You can thus decide yourself, what features you need and leave out the rest.
See https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Addons for more details.
